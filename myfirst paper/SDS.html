<h3>1.Introduction</h3>
<pre><code>The realization of controlled thermonuclear fusion could lead to a significant                       
contribution to future energy demands.                                                                                  
The reaction between the fuel components tritium and deuterium requires                      
temperatures above 10 8 K so that anyconfinement using solid walls is excluded.

At these temperatures the fuels are ionized and form an electrically highly conducting        
plasma that can be confined by strong magnetic fields to a defined volume.

During the past decades different concepts of magnetic confinement have been                
investigated and a number of conceptual designs for commercial or experimental                
fusion reactors havebeen studied.

One of those is the linear magnetic confinement in a very long solenoid (up                         
to 130 m [1]).
For strong enough magnetic fields, charged plasma particles are                                             
spiraling freely along the field lines from which they cannot escape.

At bothends of the linear solenoid the plasma is compressed by stronger magnetic                
fields created by coils of special shape (called the mirror).

Particles which move not primarily parallel to the field lines are reflected at the ends,        
othersmay leave the confinement at the ends.

A major part of the kinetic energy of  escaping charged particles can be                                  
directly converted into electric energy.

In order to avoid the very complicated mirrors it is a straightforward idea                            
to bend the former geometry and to connect both ends.

Magnetic field lines,along which charged particles move, become closed and                            
the confined plasma fills a torus.

The primary magnetic field required for plasma confinement has toroidal orientation.

The best-established machine with toroidal confinement is the Tokamak in which a                  
toroidal electric current is driven around the doughnut-shaped plasma.

The toroidal currents induce a secondary, poloidalmagnetic field, which in                               
superposition with the primary one generates nested  toroidal magnetic surfaces.

The field lines follow a helical path on those surfaces as they wind around the torus.              
Tokamaks have proven their capabilities for fusion confinement in a number of                   
experiments in several countries, from which the most prominent is probably the                 
Joint European Torus experiment

(JET) in Culham, UK, in which in 1991 the worlds first controlled release of
deuterium–tritium fusion power of 1.7 MW was realized.

Two years later the US experiment, the Tritium-fueled Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) 
at Princeton generated 6 and later 10 MW.

In 1997, JET was able to produce more that 16 MW and the upcoming international   
thermonuclear experimental reactor (ITER) will beat all prior experiments by orders 
of magnitude in fusion power, confinement time, and capital investment.

Primarily designed as aphysics experiment, ITER will also provide the opportunity 
to test a number of engineering components, which are essential elements of
future thermonuclear fusion power plants, including liquid metal breeding blankets.

A blanket is the solid structure that is positioned between the plasma and
the magnetic coils in order to shield or protect the latter ones from intolerable
radiation doses.

Moreover, the blanket has two other functions which are the
absorption of fast neutrons, conversion of their energy into heat, and breeding
of tritium, one of the fuel components.

The plasma-facing wall called the first wall receives a high heat flux emitted 
from the fusion plasma. The major heat input to the blanket occurs by volumetric 
heating due to strong neutron radiation.

To ensure safe, reliable operation, all heat released in the blanket
has to be removed at such rates that wall temperatures do not exceed critical
values.

Various engineering concepts have been discussed in the past with the
aim to achieve sufficient cooling by using liquid metals such as lithium or the
eutectic lithium–lead alloy as possible coolants.

In principle, liquid metals are prime candidates for coolants. 
They can be operated at high temperature, they have high thermal conductivity, 
and due to the lithium content the coolant  serves simultaneously as a 
material for the tritium breeding.

Blankets which rely exclusively on the heat transfer capabilities of liquid metals 
are  known as self-cooled liquid metal blankets.

In other concepts the liquid metal serves only  as breeder material while the
heat is removed by coolants like water or helium  gas at high pressure.

We will call those concepts separately-cooled liquid metal blankets.

A combination of both ideas results in the so-called dual coolant  blankets, 
where the strong heat flux from the first wall (and from other walls)
is removed by helium, while the volumetrically deposited heat is removed by
the liquid metal flow.

It would be impossible to address here all individual concepts that appeared 
during the last three decades. 
In the following we will outline some specific features of different blanket
types illustrated by examples.
