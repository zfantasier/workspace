Although it is intrinsically not a self-cooled blanket, its similarity with poloidal blankets justifies a brief discussion here.
In a dual coolant blanket the high surface heat flux at the first wall is removed by fast helium flow while the volumetrically deposited heat in poloidal breeding channels is removed by the liquid metal flow.
The dual coolant blanket avoids MHD problems encountered in self-cooled concepts for
cooling of the first wall. 
Helium cooling of the first wall provides a double containment of the liquid metal and leads therefore to improved safety and reliability. 
These basic ideas have been further advanced during the European Power Plant Conceptual Study by Norajitra et al. (2002) [41], derived from Sze et al. (2000) [42].

这些基本思想在欧洲进一步发展

Norajitra等的电厂概念研究 （2002）[41]
Sze等人 （2000）[42]。

 In the latest design all walls of poloidal channels are
helium-cooled and the fluid in these channels is insulated from the walls both
thermally and electrically by the use of SiC inserts. 
在最新的设计中，极端通道的所有墙壁都是
氦气冷却，这些通道中的流体与墙壁隔绝
通过使用SiC插入 热和电。

Electrical insulation yields
small pressured drop and thermal insulation allows liquid-metal temperatures
above the usual critical interface temperature, since the latter one is kept
low by helium cooling of the walls.
电绝缘产量
小压降和绝热允许液态金属温度
高于通常的关键界面温度，因为后者由于低氦冷却的墙壁保持不变
。


MHD issues are typically the same as for
the ceramic-wall SCLL blanket. 
MHD问题通常与之相同
陶瓷墙上的SCLL毯。

However, since the inserts at conducting walls
are not perfectly electrically insulating one has to account for leakage currents
and their consequences on flow redistribution as already described in 1993 by
Bühler and Molokov [43]
但是，由于插入导电壁
不完全电绝缘，必须考虑到漏电流
以及它们对流分配的影响，如1993年Bühler和Molokov [43]
所述

3.2 Cellular blankets
Another design concept is the cellular blanket considered in the ORNL/ West-
inghouse Tokamak Blanket Study, cited, e.g., by Hunt and Holroyd (1977) [4]
and Walker and Wells (1979) [44], who performed analyses of the MHD flow in
breeder cells under the combined action of the strong stationary toroidal mag-
netic field and a weaker time-dependent poloidal field. 
3.2蜂窝毯
另一种设计理念是在ORNL / West-
inghouse托卡马克毯研究，引用，例如，亨特和霍洛德（1977）[4]
和Walker and Wells（1979）[44]，他们对MHD流量进行了分析
裂变元素在强固定环形磁场和较弱的时间依赖极性场的联合作用下，


Here, lithium is used as
fluid. The key parameters in feeding pipes are Ha = 2.7 × 10 4 , N = 1.4 × 10 5 ,
c = 8.5 × 10 −3 . 
这里使用锂作为流体。 喂管的关键参数为Ha = 2.7×10 4，N = 1.4×10 5，
c = 8.5×10 -3。


The main design feature of this blanket, as shown in Fig.
5, is that the fluid flows along the first wall only over a short distance so
that the heat can be removed from the first wall with moderate velocity and
pressure drop, without exceeding critical temperature margins. 
该毯的主要设计特点如图1所示。
如图5所示，流体是沿着第一壁流过短距离的因此可以以适度的速度从第一个墙壁去除热量
压降，不超过临界的温度速率。

The key MHD

features here are the flow in coaxial circular pipes forming the cells, flows at
the plasma-facing hemispheres and the mechanical integrity of the cells caused
by Lorentz forces due to the pulsed poloidal magnetic field and by plasma
disruptions (accidental rapid breakdown of toroidal plasma current). 

关键MHD
这里的特征是形成细胞的同轴圆形管中的流动，流过
等离子体面对的半球和细胞的机械完整性引起
由于脉冲极性磁场和等离子体的洛伦兹力中断（意外快速击穿环形等离子体电流）。


The formation of shear layers near the first wall will leave a volume of stagnant fluid
trapped in the dome of the cell which might deteriorate heat transfer there.
An optimization of parameters for best performance of a cellular blanket was
given by Holroyd and Mitchell (1984) [45].
靠近第一个墙壁的剪切层的形成将留下一定量的停滞流体
被困在电池的圆顶，这可能会使热量传递恶化。
对蜂窝毯的最佳性能的参数进行优化
由Holroyd和Mitchell（1984）给出[45]。

3.3 Toroidal blankets
In all studies of self-cooled flow concepts the key issue is the pressure drop of
the MHD flow that is preferentially oriented perpendicular to the magnetic
field. The idea to use a toroidal flow direction near the first wall appears
already in 1971 in a report by Hunt and Hancox [2], in which the toroidal
cooling ducts are circular tubes (see Fig. 6a). 

3.3环形毯
在自冷流概念的所有研究中，关键问题是压降
优先取向垂直于磁性的MHD流
领域。 出现在第一个墙壁附近使用环形流动方向的想法
已经在1971年在亨特和Hancox [2]的一份报告中，其中环形
冷却管是圆管（见图6a）。

A toroidal flow minimizes the
magnetohydrodynamic interaction. A perfect alignment of the flow with the
magnetic field could ideally yield pressure drop as in hydrodynamic pipe flow.
The only effect which a magnetic field exerts upon the moving fluid is then
the suppression of turbulent fluctuations. 
环形流量最小化
磁流体动力学相互作用。 流畅的完美对齐
理想情况下，磁场可以产生如流体动力管道流量中的压降。
那么磁场对移动流体产生的唯一影响就是这样
抑制湍流波动。

This leads to a reduction of heat
transfer comparable to that expected for laminar flows, which, however, could
be acceptable for the fast flows at the first wall.

这导致热量的减少
转移可以与层流的预期相当，但是可以这样做
对于第一个墙上的快速流动是可以接受的。

A design that is closer to an engineering application has been developed at
the Argonne National Laboratory and published, e.g., by Smith (1985) [27].
In this concept (Fig. 6b) the first wall is cooled by a fast toroidal flow of Pb-
17Li in narrow channels. 
已经开发出更接近工程应用的设计
阿贡国家实验室，例如由史密斯（Smith）（1985）[27]出版。
在该概念（图6b）中，第一壁由快速环形的Pb-
17Li在狭窄的渠道。

The fluid is supplied to the first wall ducts through larger, slightly slanted poloidal manifolds (perpendicular to the field).
流体通过更大的稍微倾斜的极向歧管（垂直于场）被供应到第一壁管道。

 The mean velocity in poloidal ducts can be kept at relatively low values which
reduces the MHD pressure drop through the manifold. 
极向管道中的平均速度可以保持在较低的值
降低通过歧管的MHD压降。

A second advantage of
this design is that walls of poloidal channels can take higher stress levels than
the first wall since they are not exposed to the surface heat flux and receive less
radiation dosage. 
第二个优点
这种设计是极端通道的墙壁可以承受比较高的应力水平
因为它们不暴露于表面的热通量并且接收较少，所以第一壁
辐射剂量。
The flow in toroidal channels is perpendicular only to the
poloidal field which is much weaker than the toroidal one. 
环形通道中的流动仅垂直于
极端场比环形场弱得多。

Thus, the velocity
in the toroidal channels can be increased considerably over that in poloidal
ones without increasing significantly the overall pressure drop.
因此，速度
在环形通道中可以大大增加极端的通道
没有显着增加整体压降。

 Estimates for pressure drop presented by Abdou et al. (1983) [29] are near 3 MPa for the
inboard blanket and near 1.7 MPa for the outboard blanket.
Abdou等人提出的压降估计 （1983）[29]接近3 MPa
内侧橡皮布，外侧橡皮布接近1.7 MPa。

Later it was discovered that there is a potential current loop for large-scale
eddy currents across common dividing walls of radial ducts which connect the
poloidal manifold and the toroidal channels at the first wall (see Fig. 6b). 
后来发现有一个大规模的电流回路
涡流通过连接的径向管道的共同分隔壁
多极歧管和第一壁处的环形通道（见图6b）。

The
additional pressure drop due to this so-called multichannel effect (also known
as Madarame effect according to its discoverer;
的
由于这种所谓的多通道效应引起的附加压降（也称为“
作为Madarame效应根据其发现者

 he made approximations which
allowed solutions for geometries more complex than could be analyzed from
first principles [47]) was estimated to be more than 3 MPa, but it has been
shown that some kind of electric insulation could reduce this effect consider-
ably. 
他做了近似
几何的允许解决方案比可以分析的更复杂
第一原则[47]）估计超过3兆帕，但一直是
表明某种电绝缘可以减少这种影响，
很好

It should also be mentioned that the influence of eddy currents is not
uniformly distributed over all coolant ducts, i.e., ducts in the center of the
module suffer more from this unfavorable behavior. This leads to nonuniform
cooling of the first wall.
还应该提到涡流的影响不是
均匀地分布在所有冷却剂管道上，即在中心的管道
模块遭受更多的不利行为。 这导致不均匀
冷却第一堵墙。


The toroidal flow concept was attractive enough that it had been consid-
ered as a candidate for Next European Torus (NET, now ITER). 
环形流概念具有吸引力，因此被认为是下一个欧洲环线（NET，现在的ITER）的候选者。
A description
of the blanket proposed by the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe was published
in 1988 by Malang et al. [48]. 
说明
由卡尔斯鲁厄Forschungszentrum建议的毯子出版
1988年由Malang等人 [48]。

In this concept the pressure drop in poloidal and
radial channels is further reduced by the use of so-called flow-channel-inserts
(FCI), which are loosely fitted into the ducts for electrical insulation and
decoupling of neighboring fluid domains.
在这个概念中，极地的压降和
通过使用所谓的流动通道插入件进一步减小径向通道
（FCI），其松动地安装在用于电绝缘的管道中
相邻流体域的去耦。

 The feasibility of this approach has
been demonstrated experimentally by Barleon et al. (1989) [49], who showed
a reduction of pressure drop by one order of magnitude.
这种方法的可行性有
由Barleon等人实验证明 （1989）[49]，谁表示
压降的降低一个数量级。

The bright prospects offered by toroidal concepts and the challenge in
predicting associated MHD flows stimulated a number of research activities
related to radial-toroidal MHD bend flow like Molokov and Bühler [50] who
show that the flow is very sensitive to parameters like the wall conductance
and aspect ratio of toroidal cross section. Depending on these parameters
the flow exhibits a variety of flow patterns including helical or vortex-type
structures. 
环形概念提供的光明前景和挑战
预测相关的MHD流量刺激了一些研究活动
与径向环形MHD弯曲流动相关，如Molokov和Bühler[50]
表明流动对壁电导等参数非常敏感
和横截面的纵横比。 取决于这些参数
流动表现出各种流动模式，包括螺旋式或涡流型
结构。


For nonperfect alignment of toroidal ducts with the field, the
bends are called forward and backward elbows. Such flows, treated by Walker
and coauthors [51, 52], significantly differ from those obtained for perfect
alignment. Stieglitz et al. [53] find good agreement between their bend exper-
iments and asymptotic analysis for pressure drop and surface potentials for
high Ha and N . 
对于环形管道与场的非完全对准，
弯曲称为前后弯头。 这样的流动，由沃克处理

The viscous and inertial contributions were detected to scale
like Ha −1/2 and N −1/3 , thus indicating that parallel layers in the viscous and
inertial regime play a role for fusion relevant parameter values. 
检测粘性和惯性贡献量
如Ha -1/2和N -1/3，从而表明在粘性和
惯性制度对融合相关参数值起着重要的作用。

Multichannel
effects and flow coupling have been investigated by Stieglitz and Molokov [54]
and Reimann et al. [55], who show a tremendous increase of pressure drop and
inertial influence with the increasing number of electrically coupled channels.
多渠道
效应和流动耦合已经被Stieglitz和Molokov [54]
和Reimann等人 [55]，压力下降显着增加
惯性影响随电气数量的增加而增加。

But they also find that electrical decoupling of radial channels is sufficient
to significantly reduce this effect and reestablish uniform pressure drop in
neighboring channels.

但是他们也发现径向通道的电去耦足够了
以显着降低此效应并重新建立均匀的压降

flow rates without intolerable MHD pressure drop.

4.1 Water-cooled blankets
The water-cooled lead-lithium blanket that was investigated within the Euro-
pean fusion research community is based on a geometry which is closely
related to poloidal flow concepts. 
4.1水冷毯

极向流的相关概念。



The liquid metal breeder is filled in rec-
tangular poloidal channels from which the heat is removed by a large number
of inserted water tubes. A first design had been shown by Giancarli et al. [56].
The blanket displayed in Fig. 7 was presented in 2000 [57]. 

液体金属增殖剂填充—

切向通道的热是由大量删除

sons required further modifications, especially concerning the supply of the
liquid breeder into the poloidal boxes and connections of the water pipes with
the upper plenum.

 In the latest design (not shown here) the available space
for liquid metal feeding pipes was really small so that the liquid metal could
be supplied to and removed from the breeder channels only through small
circular holes machined in a massive header structure, where the wall was
much thicker than the bore diameter.

the large breeder channels is as small as 5 mm / s the velocity in the smaller

Important MHD issues in the context of this blanket concept
are magnetoconvection in long vertical containers, flows in ducts with inter-
nal obstacles, and pressure drop in ducts with very thick walls. The blanket
is based on the use of ferromagnetic steel which raises the question on MHD
flows in ferromagnetic pipes.

The use of water as coolant requires a high-pressure containment and limits
the upper coolant temperature to values below 325 ◦ C, although liquid metals
offer the potential for operating a reactor at much higher temperatures with
better thermal conversion efficiency. 
使用水作为冷却剂需要高压遏制和限制

上部冷却液温度低于325◦C的值，虽然液态金属

Another non-MHD issue of water-cooled
blankets is the permeation of tritium from the breeder into the water from
where its removal is difficult.

水冷的另一非MHD问题

毯子是氚从增殖者向水中的渗透

它的去除是困难的。


4.2 Helium-cooled blankets
Helium as a coolant in separately cooled blankets resolves some disadvantages
compared to water. Helium can be operated at higher temperatures, it is inert
and does not react with liquid lithium. For these reasons helium was already
considered as a potential coolant in cellular lithium blankets of the type shown
in Fig. 5. In a concept addressed briefly in 1985 by Smith et al. [27], lithium
was contained in tube bundles cooled by a crossflow of helium.
4.2氦冷毯
作为单独冷却的毯子中的冷却剂的氦气解决了一些缺点
与水相比。 氦气可以在较高的温度下运行，它是惰性的
并且不与液态锂反应。 由于这些原因，氦已经有了
被认为是所示类型的蜂窝状锂毯中的潜在冷却剂
在图1中。 在史密斯等人1985年简要论述的一个概念中。 [27]锂
被包含在由氦的交叉流冷却的管束中。

More recently a helium-cooled lead-lithium blanket has been investigated
within the European fusion research program. This blanket consists of liquid-
breeder-filled rectangular boxes that are arranged around the plasma similar
to the cellular blanket (see Fig. 8). 
最近研究了一种氦冷铅铅毯
在欧洲融合研究计划内。 这种毯子由液 -
围绕等离子体排列的饲养者填充的矩形盒
到蜂窝毯（参见图8）。

All walls including the first wall are cooled
by helium, which flows inside the walls in small channels. The boxes, called
the breeder units, are fed and drained from the back side through narrow
gaps that connect the breeder units with poloidal manifolds.
包括第一个墙壁的所有墙都被冷却
通过氦气，其在小通道内流入壁内。 盒子叫了
饲养者单位从背面通过狭窄的饲养和排出
将育种单位与极向歧管连接的间隙。

 It is necessary
to insert in each breeder unit a number of five cooling plates to remove the
volumetrically released fusion power and to keep the wall temperature below
critical values. 
有必要
在每个育种单位插入五个冷却板，以除去
体积释放的融合能量并保持壁温低于
临界值。

As indicated in Fig. 8 the fluid enters one unit coming from the
manifold through a small distributing gap, flows radially inwards between the
cooling plates towards the first wall, turns at the first wall in poloidal direction,
changes into the neighboring unit through a narrow gap, flows back in outward
radial direction and leaves the second unit at the back through another narrow
gap towards the poloidal manifold. 
有必要
在每个育种单位插入五个冷却板，以除去
体积释放的融合能量并保持壁温低于
临界值。 如图所示。 8流体进入一个单元
歧管通过小的分配间隙径向向内流动
冷却板朝向第一个墙壁，在第一个墙壁朝向极向的方向转动，
通过狭窄的差距向相邻单位变化，向外流动
径向方向，并通过另一狭窄将第二单元留在后面
向极向歧管的间隙。



The velocity of the flow in the breeder units
required for tritium removal is near 1 mm/s so that MHD pressure drop should
not be a serious issue for the flow in the breeder units.
繁殖单位流量的速度
氚去除所需的量约为1 mm / s，以便MHD压降
不是育种单位流动的严重问题。

 The flow through the distributing gaps, however, moves at higher velocities. Here, the flow contracts
and expands preferentially in the plane of the magnetic field, thus creating
the strongest MHD interactions. Moreover, one poloidal manifold feeds up to
eight breeder units which leads to the highest velocities and pressure drop in
these manifolds.

然而，通过分配间隙的流动以较高的速度移动。 在这里，流动契约
并且在磁场的平面中优先扩张，从而产生
最强的MHD相互作用。 此外，一个极性歧管供应
八个育种单位，导致最高的速度和压力下降
这些歧管。

MHD issues to be studied for this type of blanket are flows in slender
ducts formed by the cooling plates, and expansions and contractions at the
entrance and exit to the breeder units. The liquid metal is heated volumetri-
cally and cooled at all boundaries.
要研究这种类型的毯子的MHD问题是细长的流动
由冷却板形成的管道，以及膨胀和收缩
进出口到育种单位。 液体金属是加热体积 -
在所有边界冷静。
 This leads to strong temperature gradients
responsible for buoyancy-driven magnetoconvective flows, whose velocity may
even exceed that of the imposed forced flow. Depending on the orientation of
individual breeder units (near the equatorial plane or near top poloidal posi-
tions) Kharicha et al. [13] find either one or two recirculating convection loops
between the cooling plates. 
这导致强烈的温度梯度
负责浮力驱动的磁对流，其速度可能
甚至超过了被强制流量的流量。 取决于方向
个体育种单位（靠近赤道平面或靠近顶部极端的posi-
）Kharicha等 [13]找到一个或两个循环对流回路
在冷却板之间。


Another important point is the electrical coupling
between neighboring fluid domains at both sides of common cooling plates
or at common walls between two breeder units. Those walls are electrically
conducting, without surface insulation, and currents may pass through these
walls from one fluid region into the other.
另一个重点是电耦合
在公共冷却板两侧的相邻流体域之间
或在两个育种单位之间的共同墙上。 那些墙是电气的
导电，没有表面绝缘，电流可能通过这些
从一个流体区域到另一个流体区域的壁。
