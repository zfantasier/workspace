Although it is intrinsically not a self-cooled blanket, its similarity with poloidal blankets justifies a brief discussion here.
In a dual coolant blanket the high surface heat flux at the first wall is removed by fast helium flow while the volumetrically deposited heat in poloidal breeding channels is removed by the liquid metal flow.
The dual coolant blanket avoids MHD problems encountered in self-cooled concepts for
cooling of the first wall. 
Helium cooling of the first wall provides a double containment of the liquid metal and leads therefore to improved safety and reliability. 
These basic ideas have been further advanced during the European Power Plant Conceptual Study by Norajitra et al. (2002) [41], derived from Sze et al. (2000) [42].

 In the latest design all walls of poloidal channels are
helium-cooled and the fluid in these channels is insulated from the walls both
thermally and electrically by the use of SiC inserts.

However, since the inserts at conducting walls
are not perfectly electrically insulating one has to account for leakage currents

3.2 Cellular blankets
Another design concept is the cellular blanket considered in the ORNL/ West-
inghouse Tokamak Blanket Study, cited, e.g., by Hunt and Holroyd (1977) [4]
and Walker and Wells (1979) [44], who performed analyses of the MHD flow in
breeder cells under the combined action of the strong stationary toroidal mag-
netic field and a weaker time-dependent poloidal field.

Here, lithium is used as
fluid. The key parameters in feeding pipes are Ha = 2.7 × 10 4 , N = 1.4 × 10 5 ,

这里使用锂作为流体。 喂管的关键参数为Ha = 2.7×10 4，N = 1.4×10 5，
c = 8.5×10 -3。


The main design feature of this blanket, as shown in Fig.
5, is that the fluid flows along the first wall only over a short distance so
that the heat can be removed from the first wall with moderate velocity and
pressure drop, without exceeding critical temperature margins.

The key MHD

features here are the flow in coaxial circular pipes forming the cells, flows at
the plasma-facing hemispheres and the mechanical integrity of the cells caused
by Lorentz forces due to the pulsed poloidal magnetic field and by plasma
disruptions (accidental rapid breakdown of toroidal plasma current).

The formation of shear layers near the first wall will leave a volume of stagnant fluid

More recently a helium-cooled lead-lithium blanket has been investigated
within the European fusion research program. This blanket consists of liquid-
breeder-filled rectangular boxes that are arranged around the plasma similar
to the cellular blanket (see Fig. 8). 



All walls including the first wall are cooled
by helium, which flows inside the walls in small channels. The boxes, called
the breeder units, are fed and drained from the back side through narrow
gaps that connect the breeder units with poloidal manifolds.


 It is necessary
to insert in each breeder unit a number of five cooling plates to remove the
volumetrically released fusion power and to keep the wall temperature below
critical values. 

As indicated in Fig. 8 the fluid enters one unit coming from the
manifold through a small distributing gap, flows radially inwards between the
cooling plates towards the first wall, turns at the first wall in poloidal direction,
changes into the neighboring unit through a narrow gap, flows back in outward
radial direction and leaves the second unit at the back through another narrow
gap towards the poloidal manifold. 



The velocity of the flow in the breeder units
required for tritium removal is near 1 mm/s so that MHD pressure drop should
not be a serious issue for the flow in the breeder units.


 The flow through the distributing gaps, however, moves at higher velocities. Here, the flow contracts
and expands preferentially in the plane of the magnetic field, thus creating
the strongest MHD interactions. Moreover, one poloidal manifold feeds up to
eight breeder units which leads to the highest velocities and pressure drop in
these manifolds.


MHD issues to be studied for this type of blanket are flows in slender
ducts formed by the cooling plates, and expansions and contractions at the
entrance and exit to the breeder units. The liquid metal is heated volumetri-
cally and cooled at all boundaries.

 This leads to strong temperature gradients
responsible for buoyancy-driven magnetoconvective flows, whose velocity may
even exceed that of the imposed forced flow. Depending on the orientation of
individual breeder units (near the equatorial plane or near top poloidal posi-
tions) Kharicha et al. [13] find either one or two recirculating convection loops
between the cooling plates. 


Another important point is the electrical coupling
between neighboring fluid domains at both sides of common cooling plates
or at common walls between two breeder units. Those walls are electrically
conducting, without surface insulation, and currents may pass through these
walls from one fluid region into the other.
